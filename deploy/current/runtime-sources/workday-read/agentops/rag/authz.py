"""
Authorization checks for RAG endpoints.

The AgentOps permission model is:
  user --(role)--> org      via public.user_orgs
  project --belongs-to--> org  via projects.org_id
  user --(role)--> project via public.project_members  (NEW)

Roles (org_roles enum):
  owner > admin > developer > business_user

For each RAG action we map to a minimum required project role:
  - upload document:          developer+  (can write)
  - search / answer:          any member  (can read)
  - manage members / review:  admin+      (project leader)
  - permanently delete:       owner        (overall project lead)
